# üöÄ Advanced 3D Solar System Orbit Simulation

Welcome to the Advanced 3D Solar System Orbit Simulation! This interactive web application provides a stunning visualization of our solar system, allowing users to explore planets, comets, asteroids, and space stations in a dynamic 3D environment. You can control various aspects of the simulation, including planet speeds, zoom levels, and visibility of different celestial objects.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive 3D Simulation**: Explore a realistic representation of the solar system with orbiting planets, a sun, and dynamically generated stars.
*   **Planet Controls**: Adjust the orbital speed of individual planets.
*   **Object Information**: Click on planets, comets, asteroids, and space stations to view detailed information.
*   **Toggle Visibility**: Show/hide comets, asteroids, and space stations.
*   **Theme Switch**: Seamlessly toggle between a dark (space) and light (day) theme.
*   **Zoom Functionality**: Zoom in and out of the solar system for closer inspection or a wider view.
*   **Responsive Design**: Enjoy the simulation on various screen sizes.
*   **About Creator Modal**: Learn more about the creator of this application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with modern web technologies to deliver a rich and interactive experience:

*   **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications, providing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities.
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Three.js**: A powerful 3D JavaScript library used for rendering and animating the 3D celestial objects.
*   **@react-three/fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, making it easier to integrate 3D scenes into React components.
*   **@react-three/drei**: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for `@react-three/fiber`.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling the application with minimal custom CSS.
*   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Himanshu-Bali/advanced-3d-orbit.git
    cd advanced-3d-orbit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Set up TypeScript configuration**:
    Ensure `tsconfig.json` and `next-env.d.ts` are correctly configured. These files should have been created or updated automatically if you followed the previous steps in the chat. If not, please refer to the project's `tsconfig.json` and `next-env.d.ts` for the correct configurations.

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you use yarn
# yarn dev
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üéÆ Usage

*   **Controls Panel**: Located at the top-left, this panel allows you to pause/resume the simulation, toggle theme, show/hide comets, asteroids, and space stations, and adjust zoom levels.
*   **Planet Speed Sliders**: Found within the Controls Panel, these sliders allow you to individually control the orbital speed of each planet.
*   **Object Information Panel**: Located at the bottom-right, this panel displays details about selected celestial objects. Click on any planet, comet, asteroid, or space station to view its information.
*   **About Creator Button**: Click this button (at the top-center) to open a modal with information about the creator.
